# Documentation for `threads.py` using `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b`

## Documenting `threads.py`

This Python script defines a class `Thread` to represent a thread in a Discord server. The class includes methods for managing the thread's metadata, including its ID, guild ID, parent ID, owner ID, name, type, member count, message count, rate limit per user, and flags. It also handles pagination and can be extended with additional functionality.

### Classes and Functions
1. **Thread**: Represents a single thread in a Discord server.
   - Attributes:
     - `id`: Unique identifier for the thread.
     - `guild_id`: ID of the guild the thread belongs to.
     - `parent_id`: ID of the parent thread (may be None).
     - `owner_id`: ID of the user who owns the thread.
     - `name`: Name of the thread.
     - `type`: Type of thread (`10`, `11`, or `12`).
     - `member_count`: Number of members in the thread.
     - `message_count`: Number of messages in the thread.
     - `rate_limit_per_user`: Rate limit for each user on this thread.
     - `thread_metadata`: Metadata about the thread, including its archived status and auto-archive duration.

2. **ThreadMember**: Represents a member of a thread.
   - Attributes:
     - `id`: Snowflake ID of the member.
     - `user_id`: Snowflake ID of the user being followed.
     - `join_timestamp`: Timestamp when the member joined the thread.
     - `flags`: Flags used to manage the thread, such as auto-archive duration or locked status.

3. **ThreadMetadata**: Represents metadata about a thread, including its archived status and auto-archive duration.
   - Attributes:
     - `archived`: Boolean indicating whether the thread is archived.
     - `auto_archive_duration`: Duration in seconds for automatic archiving of threads.
     - `archive_timestamp`: Timestamp when the thread was last archived.
     - `archiver_id`: Snowflake ID of the person who archived the thread (may be None).
     - `locked`: Boolean indicating whether the thread is locked.
     - `invitable`: Boolean indicating whether the thread can be made invitable.

4. **Thread**: Represents a single thread in a Discord server, including its metadata and member count.
   - Methods:
     - `__init__(self, guild_id: Snowflake, parent_id: Snowflake, owner_id: Snowflake, name: str, type: ThreadType, member_count: int, message_count: int, rate_limit_per_user: int, thread_metadata: ThreadMetadata)`: Initializes the thread with its attributes.
     - `get_members(self) -> List[ThreadMember]`: Returns a list of all members in the thread.
     - `last_message_id(self) -> Optional[Snowflake]`: Returns the last message ID in the thread, or None if no messages exist.

5. **ThreadPaginationPayload**: Represents pagination payloads for retrieving threads.
   - Attributes:
     - `threads`: List of threads to be retrieved.
     - `members`: List of members corresponding to the threads.
     - `has_more`: Boolean indicating whether there are more threads to retrieve.

### Usage Examples
Here are some example usage scenarios and comments to illustrate how to use the `Thread` class:

```python
# Create a new thread with ID 12345, parent 67890, owner 90123, name "My Thread", type 10, member count 10, message count 10
thread = Thread(
    guild_id=Snowflake(12345),
    parent_id=Snowflake(67890),
    owner_id=Snowflake(90123),
    name="My Thread",
    type=ThreadType(10),
    member_count=10,
    message_count=10
)

# Retrieve all threads in the guild
threads = thread.get_members()
for thread in threads:
    print(thread.id, thread.name)
```

### Dependencies and Edge Cases
The script does not depend on any external libraries or modules. It is simple and should work in any Python environment.

### Example Documentation
```python
# Define the Thread class with its attributes and methods
class Thread:
    def __init__(self, guild_id: Snowflake, parent_id: Snowflake, owner_id: Snowflake, name: str, type: ThreadType, member_count: int, message_count: int, rate_limit_per_user: int, thread_metadata: ThreadMetadata):
        # Initialize the thread with its attributes
        self.guild_id = guild_id
        self.parent_id = parent_id
        self.owner_id = owner_id
        self.name = name
        self.type = type
        self.member_count = member_count
        self.message_count = message_count
        self.rate_limit_per_user = rate_limit_per_user
        self.thread_metadata = thread_metadata

    # Get all members in the thread
    def get_members(self) -> List[ThreadMember]:
        # Return a list of all members in the thread
        return [thread_member for thread_member in self.get_threads()]

    # Retrieve a specific thread by ID
    def get_thread_by_id(self, thread_id: Snowflake) -> Optional[Thread]:
        # Find the thread by ID and return it
        for thread in self.get_threads():
            if thread.id == thread_id:
                return thread
        return None

# Example usage of Thread class
thread = Thread(
    guild_id=Snowflake(12345),
    parent_id=Snowflake(67890),
    owner_id=Snowflake(90123),
    name="My Thread",
    type=ThreadType(10),
    member_count=10,
    message_count=10
)

# Retrieve all threads in the guild
threads = thread.get_threads()
for thread in threads:
    print(thread.id, thread.name)
```

This example shows how to create a `Thread` object with attributes and methods, retrieve all threads in a guild, and retrieve specific threads by ID. The script is designed to be simple and easy to understand.
