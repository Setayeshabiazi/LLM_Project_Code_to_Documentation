# Documentation for `threads.py` using `qwen2.5-coder:7b`

# Overview

This script defines a data model for threads, including their properties and metadata. It is part of a larger library that deals with Discord-related data structures.

## Dependencies

- `typing`
- `typing_extensions`

     - `flags`: Flags indicating various properties of the thread member.

2. **ThreadMetadata**
   - Represents metadata for a thread.
   - Fields:
     - `archived`: Indicates whether the thread is archived.

     - `member_count`: The number of members in the thread.
     - `message_count`: The total message count in the thread.
     - `rate_limit_per_user`: The rate limit per user for sending messages in the thread.
     - `thread_metadata`: Metadata related to the thread.

     - `last_message_id`: The ID of the last message in the thread (optional).
     - `last_pin_timestamp`: The timestamp of the last pinned message in the thread (optional).
     - `newly_created`: Indicates whether the thread was newly created.
     - `flags`: Flags indicating various properties of the thread.
     - `applied_tags`: A list of tags applied to the thread (optional).

4. **ThreadPaginationPayload**
   - Represents a payload for paginated threads and members.
   - Fields:
     - `threads`: A list of threads.
     - `members`: A list of thread members.
     - `has_more`: Indicates whether there are more results available.

5. **ForumThread**
   - Extends the base `Thread` class to include additional properties specific to forum threads.
   - Adds a field:
     - `message`: The message associated with the forum thread.

## Usage Examples

To create an instance of `Thread`, you can use the following code:

```python
thread = {
    "id": "1234567890",
    "guild_id": "123456789",
    "parent_id": "987654321",
    "owner_id": "111111111",
    "name": "My Thread",
    "type": 10,
    "member_count": 5,
    "message_count": 10,
    "rate_limit_per_user": 0,
    "thread_metadata": {
        "archived": False,
        "auto_archive_duration": 60
    }
}
```

To create an instance of `ForumThread`, you can use the following code:

```python
forum_thread = {
    **thread,
    "message": {
        # Message details here
    }
}
```

## Edge Cases

- The script assumes that all necessary data is provided when creating instances of these classes.
- There are no explicit checks for invalid input, so it's the responsibility of the user to ensure valid data is passed.
