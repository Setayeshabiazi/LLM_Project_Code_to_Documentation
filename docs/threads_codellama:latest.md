# Documentation for `threads.py` using `codellama:latest`

The provided Python script is a module that defines several data structures and functions for interacting with Discord's forum thread feature. The `Thread` data structure represents a single thread in the forum, including information such as its ID, name, and type. The `ThreadMetadata` data structure contains metadata about the thread, such as whether it is archived and how long it should be archived for. The `ThreadMember` data structure represents a member of the thread, including their user ID and join timestamp.

The module also defines several functions for interacting with threads:

* `get_thread`: This function takes a thread ID as input and returns the corresponding `Thread` object if it exists.
* `create_thread`: This function creates a new thread and returns its `Thread` object. It takes two arguments: the channel ID where the thread should be created, and the user ID of the creator.
* `update_thread`: This function updates an existing thread with the given name and type. It takes three arguments: the thread ID, the new name, and the new type (if any).
* `delete_thread`: This function deletes a thread and returns its `Thread` object if it exists. It takes one argument: the thread ID.

In addition to these functions, the module also defines several data structures and functions for interacting with thread members:

* `get_thread_members`: This function takes a thread ID as input and returns a list of all `ThreadMember` objects that are part of the thread.
* `add_thread_member`: This function adds a new member to the thread. It takes two arguments: the thread ID and the user ID of the member to be added.
* `remove_thread_member`: This function removes an existing member from the thread. It takes two arguments: the thread ID and the user ID of the member to be removed.

The module also defines several data structures and functions for interacting with forum messages:

* `get_messages`: This function takes a channel ID as input and returns all `Message` objects that are part of the channel.
* `send_message`: This function sends a new message to the thread. It takes two arguments: the thread ID and the message content.

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to interact with Discord's forum feature from within Python code.
