# Documentation for `threads.py` using `codegemma:7b`

## `threads.py` Documentation

**Overview:**

The `threads.py` script provides functions for interacting with Discord threads. It allows users to retrieve information about threads, such as their ID, name, type, and metadata. Additionally, it includes functionality for pagination and accessing thread messages.

**Functions:**

- `get_thread(thread_id)`: Retrieves a thread object by ID.
- `get_threads(guild_id, limit, before, after)`: Retrieves a list of threads for a guild with pagination options.
- `get_thread_messages(thread_id, limit, before, after)`: Retrieves a list of messages within a thread with pagination options.

**Classes:**

- `Thread`: Represents a Discord thread object.
- `ThreadMember`: Represents a member of a Discord thread.
- `ThreadMetadata`: Represents the metadata of a Discord thread.
- `ThreadPaginationPayload`: Represents the payload returned for thread pagination.
- `ForumThread`: Represents a Discord forum thread with additional message information.

**Dependencies:**

- `typing`
- `typing_extensions`

**Edge Cases:**

- The script may raise exceptions if the provided thread ID or guild ID is invalid.
- The pagination options may return an empty list if there are no more pages.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Get a thread by ID
thread = threads.get_thread(thread_id)

# Print the thread name
print(thread['name'])

# Get a list of threads for a guild
threads_list = threads.get_threads(guild_id, limit=10)

# Iterate through the threads
for thread in threads_list['threads']:
    print(thread['name'])
```
